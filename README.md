The Digital Library Web App is a tool in my React application that mimics a collection of books in a virtual library. Users can browse information such as the title, author, and genre, as well as add new books and search for books. It's intended to give users a simple way to engage with a digital library, simulating the experience of a physical library in a more practical and approachable digital format.
